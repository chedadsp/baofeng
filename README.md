# Baofeng UV-5R vs UV-5RA

The Baofeng UV-5R and UV-5RA are extremely similar dual-band handheld radios. They share the same core hardware and specifications, with the key differences being cosmetic design and the firmware version they ship with. Functionally, their power output, frequency coverage, audio performance, and general durability are nearly identical. The UV-5RA is essentially a UV-5R in "new clothes," featuring a redesigned front face, but internally it’s the same radio [1][2].
